      <description>From the raw beauty of the port city of Marseille in France, my journey has taken me across continents, from the multicultural mosaic of Toronto to the charming canals of Amsterdam, and the bustling metropolis of Singapore, where I currently call home.&#xA;Along the way, my career has been enriched by extensive travel and a diverse career spanning travel, media, telecom, and tech sectors. I have contributed my analytical and consulting skills to a wide range of organisations, from small businesses to international corporations across continents.</description>

      <description>I am a certified Positive Psychology coach from Positive Acorn and aspiring ICF Associate Certified Coach.&#xA;Our coaching sessions are structured and cover wide-ranging topics except clinical issues - therapists are qualified to address those concerns. They are co-created and inquiry-based. I will not give you any advice since I am not a mentor.&#xA;I trust my clients know their context better than I do and can come up with solutions or experiments themselves.</description>
