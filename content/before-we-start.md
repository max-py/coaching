I am a [certified Positive Psychology coach](https://www.credly.com/badges/876cd7ed-01a1-4231-8e48-844883fb0a92) from Positive Acorn and aspiring ICF Associate Certified Coach.

Our coaching sessions are structured and cover **wide-ranging topics except clinical issues** - therapists are qualified to address those concerns. They are **co-created** and **inquiry-based**. I will not give you any advice since I am not a mentor.

I trust my clients know their context better than I do and can come up with solutions or experiments themselves. My role is to enable them.

You define the agenda and I adjust my coaching style based on your needs.

We will start with a one-hour intake session at your preferred schedule:
* Introduction (20-25mn)
* Coaching demo (20-25mn)
* Debrief & next steps - if any (15mn)

Ultimately, my role is to **support clients in feeling empowered and being self-sufficient**.  The coaching engagement should be as short as possible. We will most likely meet for a few weeks or months maximum.

Clients can always come back to me if needed, but I want them to be as independent and self-confident as possible. Money is a by-product of what I do, not my end goal. I do not sell packages - I think it's unethical.
