From the raw beauty of the port city of *Marseille* in France, my journey has taken me across continents, from the multicultural mosaic of *Toronto* to the charming canals of *Amsterdam*, and the bustling metropolis of *Singapore*, where I currently call home.

Along the way, my career has been enriched by extensive travel and a diverse career spanning travel, media, telecom, and tech sectors. I have contributed my analytical and consulting skills to a wide range of organisations, from small businesses to international corporations across continents.

My experiences have fostered a deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of cultures and the transformative power of personal growth. I am passionate about **guiding others** to **navigate life's complexities** with **authenticity** and **resilience**. I am an avid foodie, experimental cook, aspiring sommelier, tech junkie, fan of electro, jazz, and indie rock, and a lover of wild animals and tropical plants.
